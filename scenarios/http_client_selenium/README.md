# HTTP Selenium

This scenario shows basic usage of a [Selenimu web browser automation framework](https://www.seleniumhq.org/).
It can run test generated by [Selenium IDE](https://www.seleniumhq.org/selenium-ide/). There are available
plugins for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selenium-ide/mooikfkahbdckldjjndioackbalphokd) 
and [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/selenium-ide/) for test recording. The recorded test can be
saved saved in the `sides` directory located in the root of the project.

The tests are run once per the container startup, but scenario will run the container again until time is over.
